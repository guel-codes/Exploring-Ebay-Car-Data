# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Data
This DataQuest Guided project was to clean and analyze Car Sales Data from Ebay.


There are still some things that can be done to further clean and analyze the data. I will come back to these additional tasks at a later date.

Data cleaning next steps:
- Identify categorical data that uses german words, translate them and map the values to their english counterparts
- Convert the dates to be uniform numeric data, so "2016-03-21" becomes the integer 20160321.
- See if there are particular keywords in the name column that you can extract as new columns

Analysis next steps:
- Find the most common brand/model combinations
- Split the odometer_km into groups, and use aggregation to see if average prices follows any patterns based on the milage.
- How much cheaper are cars with damage than their non-damaged counterparts?
